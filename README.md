GenAI Legal Assistant for SMEs

This app helps users understand legal risks in contract text, especially Intellectual Property clauses. It uses simple rule-based checks together with an AI model (Groq) to explain who owns the work, whether the clause is risky, and what a safer alternative could be for small businesses.

Users can paste contract text or upload text-based documents such as PDF or DOC files. The app automatically detects the language, splits the contract into clauses, and analyzes each clause separately. It supports both English and Hindi, and the generated PDF reports display Hindi text correctly.

For each risky clause, the app shows a clear explanation in simple English and suggests a more balanced version. Risk results are saved automatically, and a clean PDF report can be generated for review. This tool is meant for understanding and first-level review only and does not replace legal advice from a professional.
